# Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction

## About the Project
The Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction project is a data science initiative that leverages Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and forecast energy consumption patterns. This project aims to provide insights into energy usage trends and predict future consumption based on historical data.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Perform detailed analysis of historical energy consumption data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Visualization:** Utilize various data visualization techniques to present insights in an intuitive and comprehensible manner.
- **Prediction Models:** Develop and implement predictive models to forecast future energy consumption.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis and model development.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DhanushSM/Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-prediction
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the project directory to explore the data analysis and prediction workflows.
- Follow the steps in the notebooks to perform data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and prediction.
- Modify the notebooks as needed to experiment with different data sets and models.
